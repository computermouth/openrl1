### openrl1

This project aims to create a complete, free asset pack for use with the [RogueLegacy1](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/RogueLegacy1) codebase.

A LICENSE will be determined by contributing members, but it'll be something extremely permissive like MIT, CC-BY-SA, or similar.

## What needs to be done?

- Determine what files are required to run the game
- Replace all of them with new custom resources (sprites, sounds, music)
- Package and distribute the asset pack as a drop-in replacement for the original
- Potentially package and distribute the game code + asset pack as a full game distributable ([more info here](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/RogueLegacy1/issues/2))

## Where can we organize?

I've created a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mp4zDfKefj) to get a quick place set up.
